Hi, I'm David WU. I'm looking fro renting a bedroom from May 01 - Aug. 31 2019 when I'll be an intern in an IT branch of a company that located at 5700 Yonge. I'm a non-smoker, non-alcohol, non-drug. Is the room still available from May 01?

In March, I continued to learn Java Web server by using Spring Framewrok that has not been taught in college. In John Abboott, Java and C# are all been taught, and in the last two course we used c# to creat web server. 

Meanwhile, I took a job interview with Flink who needs Web scraping Specialist. They replied me that my coding ( RestSharp and Selenium ) is OK, but they need  finding  real seniors for this position.
